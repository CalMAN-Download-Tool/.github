## üìå About the Software
**CalMAN** is a professional display calibration and verification toolkit for Windows. It provides guided workflows, measurement control, and profile generation to achieve accurate color reproduction for monitors, TVs, and projectors.

## ‚ùì What is CalMAN?
CalMAN automates calibration sequences with precision meter support, generates LUTs and ICC profiles, and validates targets (gamma, white point, color gamut, grayscale). Used in post-production, broadcast, and pro AV to ensure reliable color delivery.

## ‚úÖ Why Choose CalMAN?
- Guided calibration workflows for repeatable results  
- Support for a wide range of colorimeters and spectroradiometers  
- 3D LUT creation and ICC profile export for displays and LUT-capable devices  
- Verification tools for gamut, grayscale, and HDR targets  
- Reporting and pass/fail validation for professional workflows  
- Profiles suitable for editing, grading, and final delivery

## üîß Key Features
- Meter control and automation for supported instruments  
- AutoCal and manual calibration workflows  
- HDR workflow support and PQ/HDR10 validations  
- 3D LUT generation for external LUT loaders and GPUs  
- Detailed calibration reports and graphs  
- Integration with workflow tools and broadcast standards  
- Profile import/export (ICC, LUT) and backup management

## üñ•Ô∏è System Requirements
- Windows 10/11 (64-bit)  
- Supported colorimeter or spectroradiometer (see vendor list)  
- USB ports for meter connectivity  
- 500 MB free disk space (more for LUT projects)  
- Administrator rights for driver installs

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Usage
1. Connect supported meter and install drivers.  
2. Launch CalMAN and select target device and workflow.  
3. Follow guided steps: measure, iterate, generate LUT/profile.  
4. Export ICC/3D LUT and apply to display pipeline.  
5. Save report and archive calibration files.
